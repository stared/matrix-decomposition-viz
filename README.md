# matrix-decomposition-viz

(Work in progress!)

Aimed as an inteactive widget for a [Distill](https://distill.pub/) article on matrix factorizations in machine learning:

* compression and generalization (PCA, word2vec)
* recommender systems and filling missing data
* interpretable models (item response theory, somethimes PCA)

I wrote nummerics in pure JavaScript (it was before TensorFlow.js times). Debating whether to rewrite D3.js part into Vue.js to make it easier to modularize it.

If you want to collaborate or this vis, or reuse it, drop me an email, or raise an issue here.
